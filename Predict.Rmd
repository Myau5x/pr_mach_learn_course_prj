First of all I clean data. I remove columns where more than 95% values were missing.
```{r}
train <- train %>% select( which(colMeans(is.na(.)) < 0.95))
train <- train %>% select( which(colMeans(.=="") < 0.95))
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
