First of all I clean data. I remove columns where more than 95% values were missing. Also I remove column "X" just because it is convinient to me.
```{r}
train <- train %>% select( which(colMeans(is.na(.)) < 0.95))
train <- train %>% select( which(colMeans(.=="") < 0.95), -X )
```

Then I created model. I use method random forest.

Accuracy of my model on training set is.

```{r}
confusionMatrix(train$classe,predict(ModelRF,train))
```
